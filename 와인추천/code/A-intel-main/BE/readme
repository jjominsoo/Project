French characters with phonetic symbols are broken in MySQL, but there is no problem in the database itself, 
and columns containing broken characters are not included in the recommended category within the service, so we do not modify them separately.

Additionally, when outputting from programs other than MySQL, such a breaking phenomenon does not occur. (Except for Excel)
